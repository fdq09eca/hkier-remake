## Introduction

The expected labour migration to GBA are not necessarily skilled labour exclusive; in fact, the flow of migrant toward Gangdong area are mixed with skill and less-skilled labour. Although the former are policy targeted talents, the latter are relatively disadvantaged. Talent or educated labour may secure a position in the mega city due to their in-demand skillset, making a living for the less skilled labour are, in contrast, not as easy. In turn, their rough life experience introduce different health or mental issues. Besides, regardless the skill level, migration affects their next generation daily life drastically. The migrants and their children well-being will be taken into account in our review

## Mental/physical health

2. {% cite CHEUNG2013121 %} compared rural-to-urban migrant adolescents and urban native adolescents to examine the relationships between victimization, local and trans-local ties, and mental well-being that might be unique to migrants.

   - They found victimization was associated with suboptimal psychological health in both the migrant and urban native samples.
   - they found social ties directly boosted psychological health in both samples, with the effects of trans-local and local ties proving equally important among migrant adolescents
   - They suggested better understanding of victimization stress and how it is affected by the locality of social ties as a coping resource could help to protect the health of young migrants in urban China.

4. {% cite xu2015causal %} applied propensity score matching methods to estimate the effects of migration in 2417 children 10–15 years old from a 2010 national survey

   - They found children’s migration has significant positive effects on their objective well-being.
   - Their results reveal there is little difference between the left-behind and non-migrant children across multiple life domains.
   - The Rosenbaum bounds tests indicate that the causal effects of child migration are sensitive to hidden bias for certain outcomes, but not for others.

6. {% cite liu2017subjective %} conducted a survey in GuangZhou to discuss the subjective wellbeing of the migrants

   - They found migrants' self-evaluated welling being is, in general, lower than the local.

7. {% cite chen2019effects %} using Hong Kong Panel Study of Social Dynamics (HKPSSD), they estimate the effects of neighbourhood discrimination towards immigrants from Mainland China on the mental health of Chinese residents in Hong Kong.

   - They found a higher level of immigrant discrimination is associated with a lower level of psychological distress for both post-1997 Mainland immigrants and other Chinese residents in Hong Kong
   - They suggested that immigrant discrimination can signify a prejudice that leads to social distance or avoidance and that the post-1997 Mainland immigrants do not have extensive contact with other local residents in Hong Kong.
9. {% cite lu2019relaxation %} conducts a cross-sectional survey using the Chinese version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in urban and migrant schools in the capital, Hangzhou, and in schools in two rural counties of Zhejiang Province.

   - They found migrant children were the most vulnerable to psychological problems.
   - They suggested improving conditions in urban areas for these children and ensuring their access to urban public schools.

## Education performance and behaviour
1. {% cite liang2010educational %} used data from the 1995 China 1% Population Sample Survey to examine the school enrolment of migrant children who resided in cities of Guangdong province in 1995.

   - They found temporary migrant children are much less likely to be enrolled in school compared to local children.
   - Rural temporary migrant children from Guangdong also encounter a major disadvantage in terms of school enrolment
   - They suggest these disadvantages faced by temporary migrant children is likely to have detrimental and long-term consequences for migrant children and for urban society as a whole.


3. {% cite HU20141 %} using data from the 2011 Survey on Social Integration of Migrant Children in Wuhan, China, this study examined psychological and behavioural problems of migrant and left-behind children.

   - Results showed that left-behind and migrant children had poorer psychological and behavioural outcomes than local children but difference disappeared after controlling for family and school characteristics.

8. {% cite xu2018migrant %} conducted survey for 476 migrant children on educational processes and family influences in Tianjin China.

   - These children reported a fair-to-good subjective happiness level
   - They found subjective happiness will rise alongside nine improvements: (1) public school enrolment, (2) non-discriminatory admission to education, (3) targeted assistance for higher grade students, (4) integrated local-migrant classes, (5) teacher-student interactions, (6) extracurricular activities, (7) academic performance, (8) parent-child communication, and (9) friends in the city.
