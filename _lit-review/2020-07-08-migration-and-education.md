## Human Capital {#human-caption}

1. {%cite wei2008role%} examined empirically the role of human capital on China's economic growth.

   - They previously used provincial data from 1996 to 2004 which showed an insignificant effect of human capital and a sizeable and significant effect of fixed capital investment on economic development.
   - After correcting the endogeneity and using the 2SLS approach, they found the fixed capital investment loss its significance.
   - They suggested human capital has already played a significant role in China's economic development.
   - They predicted China's regional growth inequality may increase in the future because eastern areas traditionally have a large stock of college-educated workers and college-educated workforce is more likely to attract physical capital investment.

2. {%cite khor2016china%} suggested large discrepancies between official statistics on educational attainment in China and data from in-the-field academic human capital studies.
   - they used the sixth population census data to show that China’s human capital is shockingly poor compare to the average upper secondary attainment rate in OECD countries by demonstrating the statistics on upper secondary education reported by the Ministry of Education are overestimated.
   - They suggested effort to improve enrolments in upper secondary school, since they predicted there will be a high demand of skilled labour in the soon future of China.
   - They future warned that failing to do such improvement in education, not only massive unemployment will likely occur but also the newly emerging industries may also falter owing to the lack of skilled workers.

## Migration {#migrant}

1. {% cite li2007cross %} drawn data from questionnaires and interview from HKU, HKUST, MU and MUST discuss the pull and push factors of cross-border higher education Chinese student in Hong Kong and Macau.

   - They suggest that mainland students in Macau valued economic factors such as economic income and competitive ability in the employment market more than their counterparts in Hong Kong where they emphasis on academic enhancement and social/cultural experience
   - The closer distance of HK/Macau and China are also their consideration as most of the research postgraduate have family and children.

2. {% cite liu2014jobs %} confirmed the skill labour flow are in general towards eastern-region provinces such as Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu.

   - They find that job related factors have dominating importance for the skilled labours' moving decision. However, other than wage, the climatic, social and culture amenities such as medical and cultural resources are also taken into their account of moving, less however.
   - They argue that although in their study the effect of amenities is less influential, it is expected to be more important in the future because the professional and managerial skilled worker become increasingly wealthy and emphasising work-life balance.
   - Besides, they found that the opportunity of university education for children is not valued for the skilled people destination choices unless they have the _hukou_ of the destination, conceivably due to regional discrimination in the process of university admission.
   - They suggest that although China has implemented a series of hukou reform and has lowered the _hukou_ threshold for wealthy and highly educated migrants in recent years, the system remained a powerful gatekeeper that divides local hukou holders and non-local hukou holders. For example, the opportunities of universities education for children are secondary consideration for skilled worker's decision unless they hold the destination _hokou_ due to the regional discrimination in the universities admission process.

3. {% cite to2014destination %} use questionnaire approach to discuss the choice of destination of the cross-border Chinese students within the Greater China Area.

   - The data was drawn by 326 questionnaire which only 3 of them are completed by non local HK higher education student.
   - They found programme reputation, recognition of university qualifications, availability of course information, safety and cost of living in the host cities

4. {% cite shen2015explaining %} estimates the effects of changing parameters in migration models and the changing demographic, social, and economic attributes in origin and destinations on migration flows.

   - Their decomposition result shows that 62.28% of this increase was due to changes in the value of explanatory variables, while 37.72% was due to changes in the value of model parameters.

5. {% cite dustmann2016economics %} proposes a general theoretical framework for modelling temporary migration decisions based on which they outline the various motives for temporariness.

   - It discusses the possible consequences of migration temporariness for non-migrants in both home and host countries
   - Home: remittances; brain drain and brain gain
   - Host: fiscal impact; marginal productivity of labour

6. {% cite SHEN20161 %} conducts a comparative analysis of skilled and less-skilled migration in China, using the 2005 one percent population sample survey data.

   - they found that migration asymmetry existed among less-skilled migration in the period 2000–2005.
   - The top regions, such as GuangDong, Shanghai of relative attractiveness for skilled migration were similar to those of less-skilled migration.
   - Their model predicts that individuals who were younger, did not have children and elderly household members, and were engaged in non-agricultural work were more likely to migrate away from their original province, regardless of their skill levels.
   - Less-skilled migrants tended to leave areas with a large population, a small non-agricultural sector, a high unemployment rate, and a small amount of foreign investment
   - Skilled migrants tended to leave areas with a small population, an excessive supply of university graduates, a small non-agricultural sector, and a low wage level.

7. {% cite yuen2017studying %} focus on Mainland students who have completed teacher education programmes in Hong Kong and then served as teachers in Hong Kong schools (Mainland teachers). They discussed the attraction of them to stay and work in Hong Kong and the challenges they faced.

   - They found the most highly rated extrinsic motives to settle in Hong Kong were higher salaries, better career paths, and the international environment. A better quality of life and political freedom are also mentioned.
   - Intrinsic pull factors include professional autonomy, opportunities to teach using innovative methods, and being able to help students to be independent thinkers.

8. {% cite zhang2018mode %} using Hong Kong Panel Study of Social Dynamics (HKPSSD) and the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) examines occupational attainment of Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong by comparing immigrants from Guangdong province with people who stayed in Guangdong and Hong Kong natives.

   - They found that Chinese immigrants have significantly lower occupational attainment, measured by International Socioeconomic Index (ISEI), than their counterparts in both the origin and the destination.
   - They also found that age of arrival to Hong Kong significantly matters to the occupational attainment.
   - Disadvantages exist for documented immigrants and those who arrived in Hong Kong at age 13 or older, whereas undocumented immigrants and those who arrived younger than 13 do not differ significantly from either Guangdong stayers or Hong Kong natives.

9. {% cite fong2018immigrant %}

10. {% cite tan2020temporary %} used participant observations and semi-structured interviews to suggests that the temporary status of migrants and fast-paced work schedules of manufacturing factories limit migrants’ options for after-work leisure activities both spatially and temporally.

## Return to education {#edu-re}

1. {% cite whalley2014regional %} using education as a measure of skill, they draw on data from 1995, 2002 and 2007 China household income project (CHIP) to estimate skill premia at the province and/or prefecture (or city) levels.

   - They found although skill premia increased in nearly all provinces between 1995 and 2002, there was not such increase be-tween 2002 and 2007 except in the coastal provinces.
   - Data from the 2007 survey indicate a strong positive relationship between export orientation and skill premia,with the coastal provinces exhibiting much higher skill premia than non-coastal provinces.

2. {% cite gao2015education %} using three waves of the China Urban Labour Survey (CULS 2001, 2005, 2010) to examines the effect of the expansion in education on the returns to schooling in urban China for migrants and non-migrants.

    - They found the premium to education increased by about 2%–3% over a period in which there was a rapid increase in education levels
    - This result is consistent with the demand for skilled labour increasing at a time when China tries to move up the value-added chain and an observed increase in urban wage inequality
    - In addition, the education premium is higher for non-migrants than migrants and higher for males than females.

3. {% cite sakellariou2016returns %} using 2009 Rural Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) to estimate returns to schooling for rural-to-urban migrants and urban residents in China by instrumental variable estimation.

   - The estimated the return of education are around 6–9% for urban workers compared to 7–8% for migrant workers.
   - Returns for men (at 8–9%) are slightly higher than for women (at 6–7%).
   - Private returns to education in urban China in 2009 were not as high as other transition and developing countries, but substantial and have increased over time.

4. {% cite ma2017higher %} conducted an empirical study to estimate the private internal rate of return to years of schooling (IRR) in China during the period after the implementation of higher education expansion policy using data from the Chinese General Social Survey data conducted in 2006 and 2014

   - They found that overall, from 2005 to 2013, the IRR decreased from 8.6% to 7.8% for the total sample, from 8.3% to 7.4% for men, and from 9.0% to 8.2% for women.
   - IRR of the high-level education group is higher than the low, middle and high-level education groups in both 2005 and 2013
   - They suggest that the higher education expansion policy negatively affected the IRR at university level, but positively affected the IRR at graduate school level
   - while they suspect that the reduced IRR at university level is due to the problem of over-education for university graduates, they also consider higher education extension policy may promote technological innovation and raise the IRR of graduate school graduates and urge for further investigation.

5. {% cite wang2017economic %} examine economic returns to proficiency in English in China using two waves of the China Labour-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS)

   - They found positive earnings returns to proficiency in English.
   - The returns to proficiency in English are higher in the eastern region e.g. Guangdong and Shanghai, higher for women and evidence of education-language and skill-language complementarity.
   - They also observed urban locals English have more return than the migrants.

6. {% cite wang2018returns %} using CHIP2013 to determine the returns rate difference between those in the rural and urban areas.

   - They found the rate of returns to education for the general samples was 13.9%. This, therefore, was higher than the rate (around 10%) in 2000-2010 in China.
   - There was a significant difference between rural (3.7%) and urban (25.6%) areas.
   - The gender equality testing showed that in rural areas, the rate of returns to education for females (9.1%) was much higher than males (2.5%).
   - The results provided an overview of the current situation regarding the educational investment in China. It also pointed out the income and educational inequality between rural-urban and male-female.

7. ~~{% cite hu2018three %} irrelevant~~

8. {% cite asadullah2019labor %} examine China economic returns to education using data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2010.
   - Gains from schooling rise sharply with higher levels of education. The estimated returns are 12.2% in urban provinces and 10.7% in coastal provinces, higher than in rural and inland areas.
   - Wage premium for workers with good English skills (speaking and listening) is 30%
