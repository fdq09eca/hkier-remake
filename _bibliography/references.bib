abstract = "This paper conducts a comparative analysis of skilled and less-skilled migration in China, using the 2005 one percent population sample survey data. It is found that migration asymmetry existed among less-skilled migration in the period 2000–2005. The degree of migration asymmetry is less severe among skilled migrants than less-skilled migrants as the origins of less-skilled migration were much more concentrated than those of skilled migration. The top regions of relative attractiveness for skilled migration were similar to those of less-skilled migration. The relative emissiveness of skilled migration was less evenly distributed than that of less-skilled migration. Logistic models indicated that individuals who were younger, did not have children and elderly household members, and were engaged in non-agricultural work were more likely to migrate away from their original province than their counterparts, regardless of their skill levels. Less-skilled migrants tended to leave areas with a large population, a small non-agricultural sector, a high unemployment rate, and a small amount of foreign investment, while skilled migrants tended to migrate away from areas with a small population, an excessive supply of university graduates, a small non-agricultural sector, and a low wage level."

Consequently, migrant and left-behind children have greatly increased in number. Using data from the 2011 Survey on Social Integration of Migrant Children in Wuhan, China, this study examined psychological and behavioral problems of migrant and left-behind children. Results showed that left-behind and migrant children had poorer psychological and behavioral outcomes than local children. However, the difference disappeared after controlling for family and school characteristics. The findings provided implications on improving psychological and behavioral outcomes of migrant and left-behind children through family intervention and education policy reform."

abstract = "Despite the emerging literature on the health of rural-to-urban migrant children in China, few studies have addressed victimization stressors and stress-buffering mechanisms related to the social relationships that link migrants to their host cities (local ties) and home communities (trans-local ties). This study compared rural-to-urban migrant adolescents and urban native adolescents to examine the relationships between victimization, local and trans-local ties, and mental well-being that might be unique to migrants. Participants were 482 migrant students and 838 urban native students in the eighth grade in Guangzhou who completed a school-based survey in spring 2011. Victimization was associated with suboptimal psychological health in both the migrant and urban native samples. Social ties directly boosted psychological health in both samples, with the effects of trans-local and local ties proving equally important among migrant adolescents. While both local and trans-local ties moderated the effect of victimization on migrant adolescents, that moderation mattered less for urban native youth. These results highlight that a better understanding of victimization stress and how it is affected by the locality of social ties as a coping resource could help to protect the health of young migrants in urban China."
